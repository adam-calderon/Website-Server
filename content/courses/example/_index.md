## Course Description

What does it mean to live a life well lived? Can science inform how you can live your own best
life? The main mission of this course is to provide an up-to-date understanding of theoretical,
empirical, and applied advances in the science of well-being and self-actualization.
Consideration will be given to conflicting viewpoints and their respective empirical support,
including the benefits of embracing both comfortable and uncomfortable emotions, the
measurement and development of different models of well-being, and the latest science of
attempts to increase well-being. The course is grounded in the core principles of humanistic
psychology, and will cover essential human needs, including health, security, growth,
mindfulness, self-esteem, connection, love, creativity, resiliency, purpose, flow, gratitude, awe,
and other forms of transcendence. We will also cover the implications of the latest science for
cultivating healthy institutions— spanning education, work environments, healthy families,
humane leadership, and the development of civic virtues— that are growth-fostering and bring
out the best in everyone. Throughout the course we will engage in experiential learning and
practical exercises to further help you nurture what’s best within you— and become a whole
person— which will inform our theoretical and empirical understanding of the latest scientific
findings. My hope is that in addition to enhancing your appreciation of how the scientific method
can inform the good life, the activities and information in this course will also help you in
your own personal journey to realize your greatest strengths and become more fully human—
accepting and becoming flexible with the totality of who you are, so that you can become the
person you most want to become.

## Learning Objectives

The mission of this course is to provide an up-to-date understanding of theoretical and empirical
advances in the science of well-being and self-actualization. More generally, my hope is that this
course enhances your appreciation of how the scientific method can improve human flourishing,
and advance our understanding of the human condition.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:
- Understand and articulate key concepts, findings, and controversies in the emerging
science of well-being and self-actualization,
- Understand the research methods (including measures, interventions, and research
paradigms) used to assess well-being and self-actualization,
- Evaluate evidence for the validity, both internal and external, of empirical claims in
contemporary scientific research on well-being and self-actualization,
- Articulate from first-hand experience with activities a perspective on how the science of
well-being and self-actualization is (or is not) relevant to your life, and can help you
realize your greatest strengths.
